# Manusha Vemulapalli - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Manusha Vemulapalli! I have an analytical background in Data Science and currently, I hold a Master's degree in Industrial Engineering, with a minor in Computer Science and a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I have developed a strong foundation in computer science and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science as an entry-level data analyst. 

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data analyst.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
